EP is inspired by many different sources. This is our take on it - drawing from the work of Kevin Cole, Scott Barrett, Josh Hermsmeyer, and many many others before us. 

You can read about Kevin Cole's methodologies here:

https://predictivefootball.com/week-2-expected-fantasy-points-rushing-and-receiving/ 

We used a lot of the same components, but combined a few other factors into a multiple regression model (absolute airyards makes a comeback!) and predicted the individual components of fantasy scoring (rush yards, rush TDs, receptions, receiving yards, receiving TDs, first downs). 

This wouldn't be possible without the fantastic resource that is NFLscrapR - both for training the model as well as allowing us realtime access to the 2019 NFL season. Data is updated weekly (we tried direct connecting but it crashed the server!)
