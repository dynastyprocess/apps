One of our flagship apps, the DynastyProcess.com Trade Calculator features unparalleled control of trade values built on [FantasyPros Dynasty Ranks](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/dynasty-overall.php). Here's a quick rundown of what you can customize: 

- QB Mode toggles between the base 1QB values and the DynastyProcess.com algorithm-generated 2QB values. 
- League Size renames rookie and startup selections based on the league size.
- The Depth Slider tunes how star players are valued relative to bench players, so you can tweak values based on league size, market preferences, and personal strategy.
- The Rookie Pick Optimism slider adjusts between our "perfect knowledge" and "realistic hit-rate" algorithms for valuing rookie picks.
- Startup Mode adds labeling so that you can assess the value of startup picks, and can also include placeholder picks for a separate rookie draft.

For more information about the values, please check out the [information page](https://dynastyprocess.com/values).

DynastyProcess's innovations are solar-powered and as a result we recommend [Light Mode](https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator). Proceed with Dark Mode at your own risk.
