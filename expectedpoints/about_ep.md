EP is inspired by many different sources. This is our take on it - drawing from the work of Kevin Cole, Josh Hermsmeyer, and many many others around us. 

You can read about Kevin Cole's methodologies here:

We used a lot of the same components, but combined a few other factors into a multiple regression model and predicted the individual components of fantasy scoring (rush/pass/receiving yards, TDs, receptions). 

This wouldn't be possible without the fantastic resource that is nflfastR - both for training the model as well as allowing us extensive access to the 2020 NFL season. Data is updated weekly.
